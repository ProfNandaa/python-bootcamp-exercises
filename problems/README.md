#Problems


##Problem 1
Write a program that opens http://google.com/ every 5 seconds, for 3 times.

##Problem 2
Create a list containing URLSs and delay time. Write a function that takes this list and opens each of the URLs and gives a delay equal to the delay time after each URL is open. 
e.g. 
```
[[url1,10],[url2,20],[url3,30]]
```

For the above example, url1 opens and the delays for `10s` and the `url2` opens and then delayes `20s` and so on.

##Problem 3
Copy the contest of [this gist](https://gist.github.com/andela-cnnadi/3813f2a5e3e01931493e) and save it in a file, e.g. `passwords.txt`. 

A valid password has to have atleast 4 numbers, 2 lowecase letters and 4 uppercase letters.

Run through the file and print out the number of valid passwords.

##Problem 4
Write a function `max_negative`, given a `list` of integers, return the **largest negative** number in the list. e.g. `[-20,5,10,-3,-50]` should return `-3`.
